# Data Analytics Profile

Hi all, my name is Rachelle - a healthcare administrator transitioning into the world of data analytics. Google Data Analytics certified.

This repository is a portfolio of projects I’ve built to practice and showcase my skills in **SQL, Python, R, and Excel**. 
These projects are linked on my LinkedIn and are continuously evolving as I grow my skill set.

## Skills & Tools

- **SQL** – querying, data cleaning, BigQuery  
- **Python** – pandas, data wrangling, exploratory analysis, visualization  
- **R** – data cleaning, data analysis, tidyverse, statistical exploration, R Markdown
- **Excel** – pivot tables, formulas, dashboards, data validation  
- **Version Control** – Git & GitHub

## Projects

Each folder contains a README with project context.

## Project Goals

Across these projects, I aim to:
- Ask clear, business-relevant questions
- Write readable, well-structured code
- Translate findings into practical insights
- Demonstrate analytical thinking, not just tool usage

## Next Steps

- Developing end-to-end analysis projects that translate raw data to actionable insights using SQL, Python, R and/or Excel
- Practicing data storytelling by showcasing analysis' with clear, understandable summaries
- Currently learning: Advanced SQL, Python, Looker Studio

### AI Usage

I use Claude (AI) as a productivity and learning tool throughout these projects. Specifically for:
- Debugging code and understanding error messages on various platforms
- Explaining concepts during the learning process
- Generating synthetic datasets based on real statistics (NHS workforce data)

**All analysis, validation, insights, and conclusions are my own**

Thanks for checking out my work!
